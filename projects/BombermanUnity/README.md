## Description

Bomberman: CPU Wars is a local multiplayer game for 2-4 players, inspired by the classic Bomberman game. In this unique rendition, players place CPUs instead of bombs and witness binary codes instead of explosions. The destructible boxes are represented by computers. The game features three exciting maps and four different characters for players to choose from. A captivating background music score enhances the gaming experience. When a computer is destroyed, there is a chance for a power-up to spawn. The objective of the game is to survive until the end to earn points.
